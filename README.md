# MVC Pattern

This project performs simple MVC pattern. I write this project after readig *Murach's JSP and Servlets* book.

Elements of project:
- It consist of simple business logic (User) and data (UserDB).
- EmailList Servlet page controls request and response flow from server.
- JSP, HTML and CSS pages are used for web visualisation and styles.
